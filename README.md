# Automotive Experience

This repository contains a simple **black‑and‑yellow themed automotive website** designed to be hosted via **GitHub Pages**. The site demonstrates a creative layout with subtle animations and is mobile‑friendly. It features:

* A **hero section** with a floating car illustration and a call‑to‑action button.
* A **features section** highlighting sleek design, performance and innovation using icons.
* An **about** section describing the mission of the site.
* A **contact** section with a basic form for visitors to reach out.

The project is built using only HTML, CSS and a small amount of JavaScript. Feel free to clone, customise and deploy it to suit your own automotive‑themed project.
